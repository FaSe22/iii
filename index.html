    <h2>The cute Okapi: Nature's Unique Masterpiece</h2>
    <img src="https://www.marylandzoo.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/okapi_web.jpg" alt="Okapi in the wild">
    <div class="content">
      <p>The Okapi (<em>Okapia johnstoni</em>) is a fascinating mammal native to the dense rainforests of the Democratic
        Republic of Congo. Often referred to as the "forest giraffe" due to its resemblance to its much taller relative,
        the cute Okapi has a unique appearance that combines features of zebras and giraffes.</p>

      <h3>Appearance</h3>
      <p>The Okapi is easily recognized by its reddish-brown coat and striking black-and-white striped legs, which
        provide excellent camouflage in the forest underbrush. Despite its zebra-like stripes, the Okapi is more closely
        related to the giraffe. Its long neck, large ears, and prehensile tongue are all features that help it navigate
        the dense foliage and find food.</p>

      <h3>Habitat and Diet</h3>
      <p>Okapis are found only in the Ituri Rainforest in Central Africa, where they live in solitude or small family
        groups. Their diet consists of leaves, fruits, and fungi, which they forage using their long, flexible tongues.
        These creatures are secretive by nature, making them hard to spot in the wild.</p>

      <h3>Conservation Status</h3>
      <p>Sadly, the Okapi is currently classified as endangered. Habitat destruction and poaching have dramatically
        reduced their population in the wild. Various conservation organizations are working to protect their remaining
        habitat and prevent illegal poaching.</p>
